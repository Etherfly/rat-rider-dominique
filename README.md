Rat Rider Dominique
===================

This is an HTML5 RPG that started as an amateur project and continues to live as one. It's influenced by Japanese RPGs and rhythm games in the way that it handles battles. In other aspects it takes inspiration from a variety of titles. Plot is delivered mainly through text.

Currently all visuals are created by one man who is not exceptionally good at drawing, so for now it's naive pixel-arty style is one of its features.

The most interesting feature of "Rat Rider Dominique" is probably its bilinguality that allows the player to switch between Russian and English with a stroke of a key anytime.

R.R.D.'s future is uncertain, but if people will come to like what it has to offer, it will certainly be developed into a full-fledged game.
